# ML Debate Outcome Predictor  

## Overview  
ML Debate Outcome Predictor is a machine learning model designed to predict the outcomes of debates based on various linguistic and structural features. This project explores the intersection of natural language processing (NLP) and predictive modeling to assess argument effectiveness and determine likely winners in competitive debates.  

## Features  
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** Analyzes debate transcripts using text-based features.  
- **Machine Learning Models:** Implements various classifiers to predict debate outcomes.  
- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleans, tokenizes, and vectorizes textual data for model training.  
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Assesses model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
